# Economic Region Outlook Data App

This is a Dash web application that displays economic region outlook data for Canada. I found the official government page pretty difficult to parse as there aren't really any filtering features. The app lets you select a language (English or French), choose an specific city or economic region, and search for specific NOC Titles (job titles). It also includes a detailed view of employment trends for the selected NOC Title.

## Features
- Select language (English or French)
- Choose an economic region from a dropdown menu
- Search for specific NOC Titles
- View detailed employment trends for the selected NOC Title
- Data sourced and provided by the Government of Canada
